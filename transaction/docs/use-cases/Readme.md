# ZkOS Application Protocols & Use Cases

This section provides detailed specifications for common transaction patterns and application-level protocols built on the ZkOS transaction system.

These documents serve as a bridge between the core `transaction` and `zkvm` specifications and their real-world implementation.

## Protocols

- **[Contract Initialization](./contract-initialization.md):** How to deploy a new contract and initialize its state.

- **[Order Transaction](./order-transaction.md):** Placing a trade order on the exchange.

- **[Lend & Settle Transaction](./lending-and-settlement.md):** Managing lending and settlement operations.
