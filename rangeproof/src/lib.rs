//! Spacesuit is a pure-Rust implementation of Cloak protocol by Interstellar.
//! Cloak is a protocol for confidential assets based on the
//! [Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/) zero-knowledge proof system.
//! _Cloaked transactions_ exchange values of different “asset types” (which we call flavors).
//! See the [Cloak specification](https://github.com/interstellar/slingshot/blob/main/spacesuit/spec.md) for details.
